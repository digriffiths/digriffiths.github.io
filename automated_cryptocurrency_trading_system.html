		<h3>The Details</h3>
		<p>
			As a key developer in a three-person team, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing a sophisticated automated cryptocurrency trading system. This system capitalizes on the short-term market fluctuations prompted by market sentiment. 
		</p><p>
			The system processes buy and sell alerts from numerous online sources such as discord channels, emails and patreon, which are then cleaned, parsed, and analyzed using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract essential information. Further information not included in the notification is fetched through 3rd party external sources. 
		</p><p>
			Trades are executed if they meet specific pre-set criteria. Following trade initiation, the system continuously tracks market prices and implements a momentum-based strategy to decide the optimal exit point. We integrated concurrent programming techniques to manage real-time Telegram notifications, ensuring non-blocking communication and immediate updates to the team. Additionally, 
		</p><p>
			I implemented performance tracking for each process within the system, enabling the identification and optimization of bottlenecks to enhance overall efficiency. My role was crucial in ensuring precise and reliable trade execution across both decentralized and centralized exchanges, providing a dependable trading solution in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.
